Movie Data for Amazing Prime Hackathon: Extract/Transform/Load

Challenges:
- Create an automated ETL pipeline.
- Extract data from multiple sources.
- Clean and transform the data automatically using Pandas and regular expressions.
- Load new data into PostgreSQL

Findings:

I took the work I had done in the Module Week Work file and refined the code into a simple and readable summary.

The code uses three different functions created to run through, clean, and organize data. Then the tables are broken down by necessary and filled information and the columns lacking are dropped.

Finally the two data frames are merged to one and uploaded to the database.
